== SEA3D 1.5 ==
=== Up ===
  * File Struct 2.0
  * - Faster to load and reduced file size
  * - Direct Mesh Loader (no parse in runtime)
  * - Boundary vertices extended of 65 thousand to 4 billion
  * - Ansyn Texture Loader
  * - Matrices and Quaternion based
  * - Index or named references with real file formats (allows splitting SEA3D in multiple files)
  * Export Sprite3D
  * New Morph Engine for CPU
  * New Interpolation Engine
  * Animation Range by Custom Sequences
=== Fix ===
  * SEA3D Player : (Error #1125) for vertex limit
  * Export only Animations (disabling Mesh exporter for example)
  * Instance Skeleton Animation
  * Auto Detect First UV Mapping
  * New Line Exporter

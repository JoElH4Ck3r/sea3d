#summary Runtime error: CAS (policy by default) .NET Framework

= Introduction =

{{{
An attempt was made to load an assembly from a network location which 
would have caused the assembly to be sandboxed in previous versions 
of the .NET Framework. This release of the .NET Framework does 
not enable CAS policy by default, so this load may be dangerous. 
If this load is not intended to sandbox the assembly, please enable the loadFromRemoteSources 
switch. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155569 for more information.
}}}
